        "q3": "Are DryON products safe for food cargo?",

        "q4": "How long do DryON desiccants remain effective?",
        "a4": "DryON Container Desiccants remain effective for up to 60-90 days, depending on humidity conditions. This covers most standard shipping routes. For longer voyages, we recommend additional units or our extended-life products.",
        "q5": "What industries use DryON products?",
        "a5": "Our products are used across diverse industries including agriculture, dry fruits, textile and apparel, leather goods, processed food, canned items, engineering goods, automotive, and transportation & logistics.",
